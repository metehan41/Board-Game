WoW BoardGame 


 In this project, I did a simple war game. There is two sides. The first side is 
Calliance and the second side are Zorde. These sides have three characters. 
Calliance characters are Human, Elf, and Dwarf. Zorde characters are Ork, 
Troll, Goblin. You can initials board via initials.txt file and make moves 
by commands.txt file. In this game, there is some combat rule. The character 
can not move onto the friendly characters. If it tries to move, this move will 
not be executed. Characters can move on to the enemy characters. If this 
situation occurs, Characters will fight to death combat. When combat is fought to the death attacking character will attack only defending enemy 
character this attack will not affect other cells. After attacking there are three 
situations one is the attacking character has more HP than defending character 
in this situation, defending character will die, and the supporting character’s HP 
will decrease the attacking character’s HP. The second situation is attacking 
the character’s HP is less than defending the character's. In this case, the attacking 
character will die and the attacking character’s HP will decrease defending 
character’s HP. And the last situation is attacking the character and defending 
the character’s HP is equal. In this case, both of them will die. Elves and Orks 
have extraordinary power. Elf can make ranged attacks in the final attack. A ranged 
attack effect two cells away. And Orks can heal friends' characters in 
neighbor cells. The game ends when all characters on one side are dead. The game 
dynamic is simply this
